## R.P.R.O. Project - Entity #141217
This is the official recovery repository for Entity #141217.

**About Us:**
Hello, and welcome to one of the many recovery projects of the R.P.R.O.
![about_us](http://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/proxy?cache=no&src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RPRO-Project/RPRO_entity_141217/main/about_us.iuml)
We are an anonymous group of researchers, analysts, programmers, journalists, activists, and ethical hackers who are dedicated to the ideal that what we do on the internet shouldn't be deleted forever by big corporations at their discretion. It is our belief that everybody should have a second chance to see their history, and the chance to revisit things they may have created on the internet in the past. All information has value, and all information should be preserved.

### About this Entity #121417
----
This is the entity number assigned to the Twitter user [@vtCyFy](https://twitter.com/vtCyFy1/). As a courtesy service we were able to collectively set aside some of our time to recover your old NewGrounds account. We however were not able to recover the sound files from our archive system due to the way our old system functioned. We were however able to find some of your songs on your old SoundCloud account (linked in our archives) and have taken it upon us to archive those songs as a complimentary part of our release of your recovered account.

> This project is powered by the dedication of our workers here at [R.P.R.O](https://github.com/RPRO-Project/) and the hard work of the people at [Rhizome.org](https://rhizome.org) who developed [Conifer](https://conifer.rhizome.org). Special thanks to the developers of [Webrecorder](https://webrecorder.net/) who have been supportive of our cause for all the years.
